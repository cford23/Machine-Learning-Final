# Machine-Learning-Final
Final project for my Machine Learning Fundamentals course.

For my final project for this course, I tried to see if I would be able to predict whether a football play was going to be a run, pass, punt, or field goal based on different game factors. Those factors were down, first down distance, point difference, endzone distance, quarter, minutes and seconds left in quarter, and the opponent. I decided to only use one NFL team, the Green Bay Packers, since different teams have different tendencies in situations.

NFLPlaysDataset.csv contains all the offensive plays for the Green Bay Packers for the 2019-2020 season excluding kick offs, kick returns, extra points, and two-point conversions. This was a dataset I put together myself so I didn't have to worry about going through and cleaning the data (i.e. filling in missing values).
